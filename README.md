This is a project I threw together with the goal of reducing the mass of the base tool used with the Jubilee tool changer printer. It seemed unholy to clamp a Hemera tool to the changer over and over due to its weight. The base BMG tool design for the Jubilee is not too bad, but the potential of these NEMA 14 based geared extruders is worth checking out. 

Some of the modifications to the base BMG tool are:

1. Moved the the two "channels" that hold the tool platform a few mm inboard. This allowed for the use of heat-inserts for the tool wings on each side of the tool plate. The "channels" are still usable to allow changing to the Volcano hot-end.

2. Made an intermediate tool adapter to raise up the tool platform to allow space for these extruders, the space bewteen to wings is not enough, and increasing this space, while an option, would force wider tool post dimensions, preventing backward compatibility with the orginal BMG tool.

3. Modified the tool wings, using the most current o-ring version.

4. The wire-loom holder is designed to my own specs, using the 36 -nch long zip ties for cable support. This can be altered easily to suit other designs.

5. Added slots for wiring of hotend, etc to keep them away from the tool posts.

I am using heat inserts EVERYWHERE. There is a need for both the bigger ones (5mm, from the BOM) and smaller ones. You may wish to alter the files to suit the sizes of inserts you have on hand.

Print settings are the same as those spec'ed by the Jubilee project page. I used ABS+ filament for the entire devleopment process without regret.

Config setings for the extruders can be found from their specific repos. I would also recommend checking these repo's for updates as I will probably not be able to keep this repo as current as I'd like to.

I can think of future improvements already: improved cable harness, accomodating some kind of reasonable tool board. Part cooling fan improvements. Accomodating other hot-ends once they become commonly used.

Nimble version has not yet been tested, but should be fine.

A huge thank you to the designers of these shared extruder designs, as well as the Jubilee designer and the community (Discord)
